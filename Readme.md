## Features
- Upload PDF files and extract their content automatically.
- Index PDFs into vector embeddings using **FAISS**.
- Ask questions and receive context-aware answers from your PDFs.
- Powered by **LangChain** and **Google Gemini** for intelligent responses.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aditya007-source/rag-pdf.git` and `cd rag-pdf`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` (Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your **Google Gemini API key** in a `.env` file: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage
Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run rag.py`  
1. Upload a PDF file.  
2. The app processes the PDF, splits it into chunks, and indexes it using FAISS embeddings.  
3. Ask questions in the text input and get intelligent answers generated by the LLM.
